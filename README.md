## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end fraud detection system using AWS managed services. A synthetic transaction dataset is used to train an XGBoost classifier on SageMaker. Live transactions are then streamed through Kinesis, scored by the deployed SageMaker endpoint via Lambda, and prediction results are stored in S3 for querying through Athena and visualization in QuickSight. CloudWatch monitors the pipeline and triggers SNS alerts when the fraud rate exceeds a defined threshold.

## Dataset

The raw dataset (`PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv`, ~470 MB) exceeds GitHub's file size limit and is **not included in this repository**. It is stored in S3 and must be downloaded before running the pipeline.

**Download from S3:**

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/raw/PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv \
    dataset/PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv
```

> Make sure your AWS CLI is configured (`aws configure`) with credentials that have `AmazonS3FullAccess` or at minimum read access to the `finalproject-fraud-detection` bucket.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04
- Python 3.10+
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`) with IAM user credentials
- AWS services enabled: Kinesis, SageMaker, Lambda, S3, Athena, QuickSight, CloudWatch, SNS

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optimus889/AWS-Fraud-Detection-Analysis.git
cd AWS-Fraud-Detection-Analysis
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1 — Download Dataset from S3

The raw dataset is stored in S3 and must be downloaded locally before running the notebook:

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/raw/PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv \
    dataset/PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv
```

### Step 2 — Train Model (SageMaker Notebook)

Open and run `Training Model and Deploy.ipynb` in a SageMaker Notebook instance. The notebook will:

1. Download the raw CSV from `S3 (raw/)` and preprocess it with chunk-based reading
2. One-hot encode transaction types and downsample non-fraud records (3% sample)
3. Split into train / validation / test and upload to `S3 (processed/)`
4. Launch a SageMaker XGBoost training job on `ml.m5.large`
5. Evaluate the model on the test set (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.9992)

### Step 3 — Deploy SageMaker Endpoint

Continue in `Training Model and Deploy.ipynb` to deploy the trained model:

```python
predictor = xgb.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type="ml.m5.large",
    serializer=CSVSerializer(),
    deserializer=JSONDeserializer()
)
```

Note the deployed endpoint name (e.g. `sagemaker-xgboost-2026-03-13-23-05-26-528`) for use in the Lambda configuration.

### Step 4 — Configure Lambda Function

1. In the AWS Console, create a Lambda function using the code in `lambda/fraud_detection_lambda.py`
2. Set the following environment variables:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `ENDPOINT_NAME` | Your deployed SageMaker endpoint name |
| `PREDICTION_BUCKET` | Your Bucket Name |
| `PREDICTION_PREFIX` | `predictions/realtime` |

3. Configure the following Lambda resource settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Memory** | 1024 MB |
| **Timeout** | 5 minutes (300 seconds) |

4. Add a Kinesis trigger pointing to `fraud-stream`
5. Attach the Lambda execution role defined in the IAM section above

### Step 5 — Start Real-Time Stream

```bash
python3 src/stream_transactions.py
```

This script reads the raw CSV from S3, builds a balanced pool (20% fraud, 80% normal by default), and streams 1,500 transactions to `fraud-stream`. Lambda processes each batch, invokes the SageMaker endpoint, and writes per-transaction JSON results to `s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/predictions/realtime/`.

### Step 6 — Query Results with Athena

Run the SQL scripts in `sql/` against the predictions bucket. Results are saved to `s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/Athena-results/`.

### Step 7 — Visualize with QuickSight

Connect QuickSight to the Athena data source and load the dashboard configurations from `dashboard/` to explore fraud metrics interactively.

### Step 8 — Monitor with CloudWatch & SNS

CloudWatch collects Lambda execution logs, Kinesis stream throughput, and SageMaker endpoint invocation metrics. Configure an alarm to trigger an SNS notification to `fraud-alert-topic` when the fraud rate exceeds your defined threshold.
