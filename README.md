## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end fraud detection system using AWS managed services. Transactions are streamed in real time through Kinesis, scored by a SageMaker-hosted XGBoost model via Lambda, and results are stored in S3 for analysis through Athena and QuickSight. CloudWatch monitors the pipeline and sends SNS alerts when fraud rates exceed defined thresholds.

## Architecture

### Offline Pipeline (Model Training)

```
Ubuntu Local Machine
    └── offline_transaction.py          # Generate synthetic transaction dataset
        └── .csv → S3 (raw/)            # Upload raw data to S3
            └── SageMaker XGBoost       # Train fraud detection model
                └── SageMaker Endpoint  # Deploy model for real-time inference
```

### Online Pipeline (Real-Time Inference)

```
Ubuntu Local Machine
    └── stream_transactions.py          # Simulate live transaction stream
        └── Kinesis (fraud-stream)      # Ingest streaming data
            └── Lambda (inference)      # Trigger inference on each record
                └── SageMaker Endpoint  # InvokeEndpoint for fraud scoring
                    └── S3 (predictions/) # Store prediction results
                        └── Athena      # Query predictions with SQL
                            └── QuickSight # Visualize fraud analytics dashboard
```

### Monitoring

```
CloudWatch
    ├── Logs     — Lambda execution logs, inference latency
    ├── Metrics  — Fraud rate, stream throughput, endpoint invocations
    └── Alarms   → SNS Alerts (triggered when fraud rate exceeds threshold)
```

## IAM Role & Policy Requirements

This project requires the following IAM roles and permission policies to be configured in the AWS Console before running. All policies are attached directly via **IAM → Roles → Attach policies** or **IAM → Users → Add permissions**.

### 1. Local Ubuntu Machine — IAM User

The machine running `offline_transaction.py` and `stream_transactions.py` must be configured via AWS CLI (`aws configure`). In the AWS Console, go to **IAM → Users → your user → Add permissions → Attach policies directly** and attach the following AWS managed policies:

| Managed Policy | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AmazonS3FullAccess` | Upload raw data and read model artifacts from S3 |
| `AmazonKinesisFullAccess` | Put records to `fraud-stream` |
| `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` | Submit training jobs and invoke endpoint |

### 2. SageMaker Execution Role

In the AWS Console, go to **IAM → Roles → Create role → AWS service → SageMaker**, then attach the following managed policies:

| Managed Policy | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` | Training, model, and endpoint management |
| `AmazonS3FullAccess` | Read raw data from S3, write model artifacts |
| `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess` | Write training logs to CloudWatch |

### 3. Lambda Execution Role

In the AWS Console, go to **IAM → Roles → Create role → AWS service → Lambda**, then attach the following managed policies:

| Managed Policy | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AmazonKinesisFullAccess` | Read records from `fraud-stream` |
| `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` | Invoke SageMaker inference endpoint |
| `AmazonS3FullAccess` | Write prediction results to `predictions/` |
| `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess` | Write Lambda execution logs |

### 4. CloudWatch & SNS

In the AWS Console, go to **IAM → Roles → your CloudWatch role → Add permissions → Attach policies directly** and attach:

| Managed Policy | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CloudWatchFullAccess` | Create alarms, metrics, and dashboards |
| `AmazonSNSFullAccess` | Publish fraud rate alerts to `fraud-alert-topic` |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04
- Python 3.10+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate IAM permissions
- AWS services enabled: Kinesis, SageMaker, Lambda, S3, Athena, QuickSight, CloudWatch, SNS

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optimus889/AWS-Fraud-Detection-Analysis.git
cd AWS-Fraud-Detection-Analysis
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1 — Generate Dataset & Train Model (Offline)

```bash
python3 src/offline_transaction.py
```

This script generates a synthetic transaction dataset, uploads it to `s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/raw/`, and triggers SageMaker XGBoost training. The trained model artifact is saved to `s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/model/`.

### Step 2 — Deploy SageMaker Endpoint

Deploy the trained model as a real-time SageMaker inference endpoint via the AWS Console or SageMaker SDK.

### Step 3 — Start Real-Time Stream

```bash
python3 src/stream_transactions.py
```

This script streams simulated transactions to the Kinesis `fraud-stream`. Lambda automatically invokes the SageMaker endpoint for each record and writes predictions to `s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/predictions/`.

### Step 4 — Query Results with Athena

Run the SQL scripts in `sql/` against the predictions bucket to analyze fraud patterns. Athena query results are saved to `s3://finalproject-fraud-detection/Athena-results/`.

### Step 5 — Visualize with QuickSight

Connect QuickSight to the Athena data source and load the dashboard configurations from `dashboard/` to explore fraud metrics interactively.

### Step 6 — Monitor with CloudWatch & SNS

CloudWatch monitors Lambda invocations, stream throughput, and fraud rate metrics. An alarm triggers an SNS notification when the fraud rate exceeds the configured threshold.
